            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Tufts University Book Club Finder! Our mission is 
                to help you connect with fellow readers on campus, discover new genres, and engage in
                 vibrant reading discussions. Whether you're into non-fiction, 
                 poetry, mystery, romance, or academic literature, there's a book 
                 club for everyone at Tufts University.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Tufts, we believe in fostering a community that values curiosity,
                open dialogue, and intellectual exploration beyond the classroom. 
                Our platform makes it easy to connect with others who share a love 
                for reading, allowing students, faculty, and staff to come together 
                and explore diverse perspectives through books. Whether you're 
                looking to dive deep into classic literature or simply unwind
                 with light fiction, our clubs cover a wide range of interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand how challenging it can be to make time for hobbies 
                amid a busy academic schedule. That's why we've designed this 
                platform to streamline the process of finding a club that aligns
                 with both your interests and availability. With flexible meeting
                  times and a wide selection of genres, we hope to make reading
                   more accessible and enjoyable for the entire Tufts community.
            </p>
            <p> Our book clubs provide a supportive and engaging
                environment where members can exchange ideas, recommend 
                favorite reads, and build lasting friendships. Joining a book
                 club is not only an opportunity to expand your literary 
                 horizons, but it's also a way to make connections 
                 with people who might become lifelong friends.
           </p>
           <p> So, come join us, share your love for reading, and 
               create meaningful connections here at Tufts University. 
               Discover the transformative power of books, one club meeting 
               at a time!

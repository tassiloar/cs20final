                <h3>1984 by George Orwell</h3>
                <p><span>Genre:</span> Dystopian, Science Fiction</p>
                <p>Summary:A dystopian novel about a totalitarian regime led by Big Brother.</p>
                <p>Back of the Book: In a dystopian world where government surveillance is omnipresent, and history
                    is manipulated to control the masses, Winston Smith lives a bleak existence
                   under the oppressive rule of the Party and its enigmatic leader, Big Brother.
                   As Winston begins to question the Party's totalitarian grip, he dares to dream of rebellion, love, and truth. 
                   But in a society where independent thought is the ultimate crime, can Winston break free?
                   Orwell's prophetic novel explores the dangers of totalitarianism and the fragility of freedom 
                   in a way that resonates with readers today.

                <h3>Animal Farm by George Orwell</h3>
                <p><span>Genre:</span> Political Satire, Allegory</p>
                <p>Summary: An allegory of the Russian Revolution told through the rebellion of farm animals.</p>
                <p>Back of the Book: When the animals of Manor Farm stage a rebellion to 
                    overthrow their oppressive human owner, they dream of a society where all creatures 
                    are equal. But as the pigs rise to power, the dream of equality begins to crumble 
                    under corruption and tyranny. "Animal Farm" is a powerful allegory about the nature 
                    of power and politics, reflecting the complexities of revolutions, ideology, and betrayal.
                     Orwell's fable continues to be a chilling commentary on the fragility of justice and freedom.

                <p>Summary: A haunting story about an escaped slave and the ghost of her dead daughter.</p>
                <p>Back of the Book: Sethe was born a slave and escaped to freedom, but 
                    years later, she is still haunted by the trauma of her past. Living with

                    life is shattered when a mysterious young woman named Beloved appears. Toni Morrison's 
                    Beloved is an unflinching exploration of motherhood, memory, and the brutal legacy of 
                    slavery in America. Through lyrical prose, Morrison weaves a powerful story of love, loss, 
                    and redemption that resonates across generations.
